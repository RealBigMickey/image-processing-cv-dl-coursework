# Introduction to Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning (NCKU)

Assignments and projects for the NCKU course *"Introduction to Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning."*

## Assignment 1 — Interactive Image Processing GUI
A simple PyQt5 + OpenCV app for experimenting with basic computer vision tasks.  
Includes:
- Color separation and transformation  
- Image smoothing (Gaussian, bilateral, median)  
- Edge detection (Sobel, gradient, threshold)  
- Geometric transforms (rotate, scale, translate)  
- Adaptive/global thresholding  

Built for hands-on learning and visualization of core image processing concepts.

## Tech Stack
Python • OpenCV • PyQt5 • NumPy
